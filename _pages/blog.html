This blog discusses random topics in mathematics, statistics, and computer science that I find interesting or am trying to learn more about. Posts are presented in reverse chronological order, and I'll do my best to start each post with an appropriate list of prerequisites.

<h3>Posts</h3>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - {{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
