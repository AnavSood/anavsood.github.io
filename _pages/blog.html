<p> This blog discusses random topics in mathematics, statistics, and computer science that I find interesting or am trying to learn more about. Posts are presented in reverse chronological order, and I do my best to start each post with an appropriate list of prerequisites. </p>

<h3>Posts</h3>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - {{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
