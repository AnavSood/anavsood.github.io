<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a fifth year statistics PhD student at Stanford University, where I am advised by <a href=https://hastie.su.domains/>Trevor Hastie</a>. My PhD research spans topics in selective inference, dimensionality reduction, and precision medicine. Broadly, my research focuses on developing practical and interpretable statistical methods that lie at the intersection of statistics and machine learning. You can find a copy of my CV <a href=/assets/docs/cv.pdf>here</a>, and a more condensed resume <a href=/assets/docs/resume.pdf>here</a>.

Prior to my PhD, I received a BS in mathematics and an MS in statistics from Stanford ('20). Outside of academics, I spend most of my time playing jazz piano.
